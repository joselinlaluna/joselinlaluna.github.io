              "Joselin Michelle Vazquez is a Mexican American self-taught artist born and raised in Las Vegas, Nevada, on January 24,
              2004. With no prior technical art training and having dropped out of high school at age 15, Joselin had underlying
              mental health issues that she was not aware of. Now, at 20 years old, she has come to understand and accept herself and
              the reality of living with a mental illness. Joselin likes to think she inherited the desire to create from her
              Mexican-born father, who did not come from privilege unlike her. As a child, he would sell his paper drawings for a few
              coins and even dreamed of becoming an architect. However, due to the hardships he faced in Mexico, pursuing any type of
              formal education was not feasible due to the lack of resources in a impoverished community, so he did what most Hispanic
              people do and he dedicated his life to working to have a means to survive and wanting more opportunity. He often wished
              he could have pursued an artistic career but was unable to do so because of the challenges he encountered in rural
              Mexico. Joselin is very grateful to her father and mother, who has had an ongoing mental decline since her adulthood,
              and whom she was not always able to be with because of it, as well as to all the people in her life who have led her to
              where she is now. Joselin's greatest joy and passion is her work, which feels like a friend sitting alongside her, no
              matter where it may take her—whether near or far, big or small. She knows that this insatiable desire to create to
              uplift and inspire those around her is a lifeforce of its own that drives her to be a light for herself and others if
              they so wish to come along the journey, and one day, Joselin would like to expand on it to be a light for others.
              Joselin strongly believes in Humanitarian Work, Advocating for Mental health Awareness/Issues as well as Climate Change,
              and expanding our minds to embrace new, thought-provoking ideas that contribute to the greater good of humanity and all
              its beings. On one last Positive Note Joselin is currently still actively working towards receiving her High School
              Diploma in Hopes of later working towards the University of Nevada, Las Vegas"
