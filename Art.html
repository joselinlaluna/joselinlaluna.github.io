                        <p>
                        The inspiration behind my first painting, What Hurts the Most, came from a question I was only able to somewhat
                        comprehend 2-3 years after its creation: "What hurts the most?" This question was directed at myself. At that time in my
                        life, what caused me the greatest pain was coming to terms with the fact that I am alive—and so is everyone and
                        everything around me.
                        What Hurts the Most is my first and most prominent painting, one that I have great hopes for, even centuries or
                        millennia from now. The reason for this is that every single factor in my life that I once deemed unworthy, shameful, or
                        embarrassing—all the moments I considered traumatizing—led me to my truth: the ability to be present in the here and
                        now, even in the face of adversity.
                        I want to emphasize that this is solely my experience and what I’ve gathered from my situation and creation. I am a free
                        thinker and encourage all forms of interpretation; however people choose to understand it, that is the true purpose of
                        my painting.
                        With that said, human nature can be quick to dismiss others we deem unworthy or simply odd, but I urge viewers,
                        readers, and thinkers alike to ask themselves the same question. It's a question and idea some may never fully
                        understand, including myself. - Joselin Michelle Vazquez
